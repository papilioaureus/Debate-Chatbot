IS THE UNITED STATES NEGLECTING EUROPE? ,"As per the document, European policymakers worry that the U.S.'s pivot to Asia might diminish its commitment to Europe. However, it is not clear what the Europeans wish the U.S. had done differently. Despite the challenge of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the document suggests that most European governments do not seem to want the U.S. to intervene militarily. The U.S. has been pushing the European Union to introduce stronger sanctions. 

While the U.S. allowed European states to lead in Libya, Germany did not support military action there. The document suggests that the real tradeoff is not between Europe and East Asia, but between the Middle East and both East Asia and Europe. Europeans may have valid concerns since they are more exposed to disorder in the Middle East than Americans are. Therefore, the U.S.'s prioritization of Asia over the Middle East could potentially impact European security."
bye,"The document tells the story of Susie Lopez and other ""Amerasians"" who are the children of American military servicemen and Filipino mothers. Many of these children were left behind when the American military left the bases in the Philippines in the early 1990s. These Amerasians, who are often stigmatized and discriminated against due to their heritage, are reaching out to their fathers through a campaign called ""100 Letters to our Fathers"". Despite the Amerasian Immigration Act of 1982, which gave preferential immigration status to Amerasian children born in several Asian countries, those born in the Philippines are not included. They can only become citizens if their father claims them."
